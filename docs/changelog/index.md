# Release notes

The authoritative changelog lives in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md). No tagged releases have been published yet; the
`[Unreleased]` section tracks ongoing development across the workspace crates.

When a release is tagged (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) update the changelog and, if applicable, regenerate the docs index with
`just docs-index` so the summaries reflect the new features.
