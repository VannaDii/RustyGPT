# Reference Overview

> TL;DR – Authoritative details for RustyGPT’s public surfaces: authentication, REST endpoints, and configuration keys.

## Quick Navigation

- [Authentication](authentication.md) – session lifecycle, CSRF, and metrics.
- [REST API](api.md) – endpoint catalogue for clients and tools.
- [Configuration](config.md) – environment variables and TOML structure.

Reference pages favour precision over storytelling. For workflows that combine these primitives, consult the [How-to](../howto/index.md) section. When architecture informs an interface contract, the relevant page links back to [Architecture](../architecture/index.md).
