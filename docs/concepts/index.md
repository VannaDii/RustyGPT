# Concepts Overview

> TL;DR – Core principles that underpin RustyGPT’s reasoning, data model, and invariants.

## Scope

Concept pages explain *why* the system behaves the way it does. They define vocabulary, invariants, and trade-offs that appear across codebases and operational guides.

## Featured Concepts

- [Reasoning DAG](reasoning-dag.md) describes branching and joins in the orchestrator.
- [Dimensioned Entities](dimensioned-entities.md) shows how metadata travels through services.

Use these pages alongside [Architecture](../architecture/index.md) to connect ideas with concrete components.
