# Guide Overview

These walkthroughs assume you are starting from a fresh checkout. They show how to configure `config.toml`, run the
Axum server, keep the Yew frontend hot-reloading, and validate that authentication + streaming work end to end.

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) bootstraps the database, enables feature flags, and walks through the setup flow.
- [Local Development](local-dev.md) documents the `just` recipes, watcher processes, and debugging tips.

For conceptual background jump to [Concepts](../concepts/index.md); for task-specific runbooks see [How-to](../howto/index.md).
