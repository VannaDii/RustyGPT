# How-to Overview

> TL;DR – Task-oriented instructions for operating, deploying, and maintaining RustyGPT.

## Available Playbooks

- [Docker Deploy](docker-deploy.md) – build images, wire dependencies, and validate rollout.
- [Rotate Secrets](rotate-secrets.md) – refresh credentials without downtime.

Each how-to references underlying concepts and interfaces so you can trace decisions back to [Reference](../reference/index.md) and [Architecture](../architecture/index.md) as needed. Contribute additional playbooks when new operational workflows emerge.
